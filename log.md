**3.11 Gemini response:** My apologies. The Streamlit application is typically available at http://localhost:8501.

## Global Step 4
**4.1 User request:** ✕ [API Error: Model stream ended with an invalid chunk or missing finish reason.]fix it
**4.2 Gemini action:** Analyzing the error message.
**4.3 Gemini action:** Concluded that the error is internal to the Gemini API and not related to the project code.
**4.4 Gemini response:** I understand you're seeing an API error. This error seems to be an issue with the connection to me, not with the Streamlit application code. I can't fix this directly, but I will try to proceed. Please let me know if you see the error again.

## Global Step 5

**5.2 Gemini response:** 哈囉！有什麼我可以為您服務的嗎？ (Hello! How can I help you?)

## Global Step 6
**6.1 User request:** 你要在圖上標示出top 5 outliers，並且outliers的表格還要紀錄residual，表格的位置也要在最下方 (You need to mark the top 5 outliers on the plot, and the outlier table should also record the residual, and the table should be at the very bottom.)
**6.2 Gemini action:** Modifying app.py to identify, mark, and display top 5 outliers with residuals.
**6.3 Gemini response:** I am now updating the Streamlit application to identify and display the top 5 outliers on the plot, along with a table showing their residuals at the bottom of the page.

## Global Step 7
**7.1 User request:** 你的圖上還要標離群點的id，然後把最上面那個就表格刪掉 (You also need to mark the outlier IDs on the plot, and delete the table at the very top.)
**7.2 Gemini action:** Modifying app.py to add outlier IDs to the plot and remove the initial data table.
**7.3 Gemini response:** I am now updating the Streamlit application to display outlier IDs on the plot and remove the initial data table.

## Global Step 8
**8.1 User request:** 刪掉網頁上面那行Data Generation (Delete the "Data Generation" line from the web page)
**8.2 Gemini action:** Modifying app.py to remove the "Data Generation" header.
