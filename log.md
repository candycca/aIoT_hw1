3.3 Gemini action: Creating app.py with initial Streamlit structure, data generation and visualization.
3.4 Gemini response: Okay, I will follow the steps in `steps.md`. I have started by creating the `app.py` file with the basic Streamlit application structure.
3.5 Gemini action: Implementing linear regression modeling and evaluation in app.py.
3.6 Gemini response: I have now added the linear regression modeling and evaluation to the application. The plot will show the regression line, and the R-squared and MSE metrics are now displayed.
3.7 User request: run streamlit run app.py for me
3.8 Gemini action: Running `streamlit run app.py &` to start the application server.
3.9 Gemini response: I am now running the Streamlit application. It should open in your web browser.

4.1 User request: ✕ [API Error: Model stream ended with an invalid chunk or missing finish reason.]fix it
4.2 Gemini action: Analyzing the error message.
4.3 Gemini action: Concluded that the error is internal to the Gemini API and not related to the project code.
4.4 Gemini response: I understand you're seeing an API error. This error seems to be an issue with the connection to me, not with the Streamlit application code. I can't fix this directly, but I will try to proceed. Please let me know if you see the error again.

6.1 User request: 你要在圖上標示出top 5 outliers，並且outliers的表格還要紀錄residual，表格的位置也要在最下方 (You need to mark the top 5 outliers on the plot, and the outlier table should also record the residual, and the table should be at the very bottom.)
6.2 Gemini action: Modifying app.py to identify, mark, and display top 5 outliers with residuals.
6.3 Gemini response: I am now updating the Streamlit application to identify and display the top 5 outliers on the plot, along with a table showing their residuals at the bottom of the page.
7.1 User request: 你的圖上還要標離群點的id，然後把最上面那個就表格刪掉 (You also need to mark the outlier IDs on the plot, and delete the table at the very top.)
7.2 Gemini action: Modifying app.py to add outlier IDs to the plot and remove the initial data table.
7.3 Gemini response: I am now updating the Streamlit application to display outlier IDs on the plot and remove the initial data table.
